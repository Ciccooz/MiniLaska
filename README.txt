The gcc compiler is required to compile the program.
If the gcc compiler is correctly added to the system's $PATH, you will only need to run one of the executables in the _Compilers directory according to
the operating system you are using.
This will generate the game executable in the bin/Unix or bin/Windows directory.

To display the characters of the playing field correctly, the character encoding of the terminal must be IBM850.
For the windows cmd this encoding is already supported by default, for other operating systems it may have to be set manually.
